Arrays in Java:
- An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name

**Array can contains primitives data types as well as objects of a class depending on the definition of array. In case of primitives data
  types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations. In case of objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment.

1D Array:
   Declaration:
        type varName[]; OR type[] varName;

        Example: int[] intArray = new int[20];

   Notes:
    - Elements in array allocated by new will automatically be initialized to zero(numeric types), false(boolean), null(reference types)
    - First, you must declare a variable of the desired array type. Second, you must allocate the memory that will hold the array.Therefore,
      In java all arrays are dynamically allocated

MultiDimensional Array:
    Declaration:
        int[][] intArray = new int[10][20]; //a 2D array or matrix
        int[][][] intArray = new int[10][20][10]; //a 3D array

2D Array
 - rows and columns

 if(rowIndex == colIndex) => Diagonal
 if(rowIndex > colIndex) => Lower Diagonal
 if(rowIndex < colIndex) => UpperDiagonal

Dynamic Array:

 - To overcome the problem of array - usually the size of the array is fixed.
 - The size is flexible with dynamic array
Search: O(n)
Access: O(1)
Insert: O(n)
Delete: O(n)
